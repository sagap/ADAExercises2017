# What Twitter users tweet about

# Abstract

The purpose of this project is to analyse the "interest" that users of the Twitter social network show towards events happening around the globe. The analysis seeks to "connect" tweets from Switzerland and all over the world with categories of events and specific events, based on a number of variables, e.g. the coverage of the event (how many people were interested or expressed an opinion about it on Twitter), how much Twitter users keep tweeting about an event in the following months after an event etc. With the general belief being that the social network world focuses more on less significant events than more significant ones, we would like to compare and contrast users' interest in serious vs. less serious events and draw conclusions about the population's behaviour.

# Research questions
In our analysis, we are going to make a choice of event categories, such as 'political events',  'sports events', 'social crises', 'science and technology', 'showbiz and viral trends' etc, as well as a number of possible events falling in these categories. Consequently, we will try to answer the following research questions regarding a specific event, in comparison with other events of the same or different category, that occured during the same or different time period:

1. How much Twitter users (Swiss and global) tweeted about the event (in terms of total numbers of tweets and retweets)
2. How were the tweets referring to this event distributed, in the months during and after the event
3. What were the sentiments that these tweets provoked

# Dataset
For the purposes of our project, we would like to combine the datasets of global tweets and Swiss tweets. We are planning to determine whether a tweet is referring to a specific event or not by comparing the timestamps of the tweet and the event, as well as by checking for keywords and hashtags. The analysis, will be executed in two parts, one for the Swiss tweets dataset and one for the global tweets dataset.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
Our workflow and goals up until Milestone 3 are outlined below:

1. For the Swiss tweets dataset:

* Decide on final lists of event categories and specific events to be examined
* Make observations about events that occured during the same month
* Make observations about events that occured during the same year
* Describe conclusions

2. For the global tweets dataset

* Decide on final lists of event categories and specific events to be examined
* Make observations about events that occured during the same month
* Make observations about events that occured during the same year
* Make observations about events that occured during different years
* Describe conclusions

3. Final conclusions

Our Analysis is explained in the extended version (Part V) of the notebook we delivered in the [2nd milestone](https://github.com/sagap/ADAExercises2017/blob/master/project/Notebooks/Milestone2/milestone2_notebook.ipynb) and we describe and present our analysis and some data stories under the URL: https://errikos.github.io/ada-showoff/index
